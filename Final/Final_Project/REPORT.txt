Project Analysis:

	We decided to go with a infinite scroller because those are the most fun to play.
	We wanted to make a game that people could play for any amount of time.
	This also contributes to a competitive environment with people trying to get the highest score.

	The head controller class is called Final_Project and it manages two controllers (Menu and Levels).
	Menu controls the display while the menu screen is up (info, difficulty, and start).
	Once start is pressed Menu notifies Final_Project and then Final_Project switches to call Levels.
	Levels controls the display while the gameplay is occuring (player, enemies, lives, and score).
	Each of these are a class (Player, Enemy, Lives, and Score).
	Every enemy contains the same reference to score and lives.

	Ultimately we have a hierarchy of control and views passed down and managed by the sub-components.

Work Distribution:

	Nick Miller:
		Level 1
		Player Class
		Enemy Class
		Score
		Lives

	Kayla Pozo:
		Level 2
		Menu
		Music

	Vanessa Peixoto:
		Level 3
		Debug
		Artwork

Difficulties Encountered:
	
	Proper Collision testing so that whenever ANY part of the player touched the enemy a life was lost.

	Custom Button so that we could easily detect a button press has an enabled feature.
	This enabled feature was sometimes left true and could lead to accidental view switching even though it was hidden.

	The enemies sometimes looked laggy while sliding down the screen.
	To beat this we increased the frame rate and decreased their deltaY so that they moved at the same rate with no lag.
