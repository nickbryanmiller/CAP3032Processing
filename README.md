# Project 4 - Moving Double Sine Wave

It is two sine functions moving to the right.
The are of opposite amplitude so that is why they look like DNA.
The only variable being changed is the y-value for each coordinate.
The y-values change with the framecount (at a constant rate) giving it the smooth flow.
